For this practice, I created a basic Sales Power BI dashboard which visualizes sales, profit margins, and prices from scratch using a madeup data set of coca-cola.
I've uploaded the power bi file and static pdf version of the Dashboard.
The Dashboard contains the following visuals:
- AI Powered Q&A
- Key Influencers for profit margins by brand
- Map Charts for sales by region
- Matrix for price per unit and operating profit
- Slider Filter to change dates
